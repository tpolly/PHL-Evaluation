This repository contains software that was used in the study "Reevaluating Passive Haptic Learning of Morse Code" (https://doi.org/10.1145/3341163.3347714). In particular, this is the statistical evaluation of the results and plot drawing code.

The result files are expected to be in "/opt/BA/Results". You can adapt the path in load_results.R. Compiled plots are included in the plots directory.

Parts of this code are really hard to read - it wasn't intended to be used further after the study. If you ever want to adapt or extend this, feel free to contact me.
